Guan-Yan Yang is a Ph.D. student in electrical engineering and computer science at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), advised by [Prof. Farn Wang](https://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~farn/), [Prof. Kuo-Hui Yeh](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=nLG4OMAAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW), [Prof. Lun-Wei Ku](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/vita_en.html).
From November 2020 to August 2022, he served as a Research Assistant in the Department of Information Management at National Dong Hwa University. He was also affiliated with the Department of Information Management at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) from May 2021 to April 2022. From June 2023 to September 2023, he worked as a Software Engineer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), where he focused on researching artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as deep learning, machine learning, and generative AI, for solving design rule checking (DRC) problems. In 2024, he is a Research Assistant at the Taiwan Academic Cybersecurity Center (TACC), NTUST, under the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). Also, he is a Research Assistant at the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. His research interests include security, data privacy, generative artificial intelligence, algorithms, and software testing.
Mr. Yang has participated in numerous Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions. He achieved 7th place in HITCON CTF 2023 and 3rd place in DEFCON 31, representing Taiwan. Additionally, Mr. Yang was awarded a Graduate Research Scholarship from the Norman and Lina Chang Foundation, established by Dr. Norman Chang from Ansys, Inc., in California, USA. He also receives the National Science and Technology Council Graduate Research Fellowship (NSTC-GRF) in Taiwan. Mr. Yang is an IEEE Graduate Member. 
His research interests include security, data privacy, generative artificial intelligence, AI safety, and software testing. 
His recent research (with CyCraft Inc.) on fuzzing techniques for the Bluetooth Protocol was presented on USENIX Security 2024 (In this top conference, there are only three articles about purely Taiwanese teams in the past ten years).

My primarily direction is on security and privacy of AI-driven systems. My recent efforts concentrate on adversarial attacks, intrusion detection, secure federated learning, privacy obfuscation, and provable security on AI systems.

I am always open to collaborations involving dense and deep discussions, where I can learn from new explorations and intense debates regardless of co-authorship.
