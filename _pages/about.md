Guan-Yan Yang is a Ph.D. student in electrical engineering and computer science at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), advised by [Prof. Farn Wang](https://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~farn/) (NTU, Taiwan).

From November 2020 to August 2022, he served as a Research Assistant in the Department of Information Management at National Dong Hwa University. He was also affiliated with the Department of Information Management at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) from May 2021 to April 2022. From July 2023 to September 2023, he worked as a Software Engineer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), where he focused on researching artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as deep learning, machine learning, and generative AI, for solving design rule checking (DRC) problems. Since 2024, he has been a Graduate Researcher advised by [Prof. Kuo-Hui Yeh](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=nLG4OMAAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW) at the Taiwan Academic Cybersecurity Center (TACC), NTUST, under the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). His research interests include cybersecurity, data privacy, generative artificial intelligence, Internet-of-Things, and software testing.

Mr. Yang is an IEEE Graduate Member. 
His recent research (with CyCraft Inc.) on fuzzing techniques for the Bluetooth Protocol was presented on USENIX Security 2024 (In this top conference, there are only four articles about purely Taiwanese teams in the past ten years).

My primarily direction is on security and privacy of AI-driven systems. My recent efforts concentrate on adversarial attacks, intrusion detection, secure federated learning, privacy obfuscation, and provable security on AI systems.

I am always open to collaborations involving dense and deep discussions, where I can learn from new explorations and intense debates regardless of co-authorship.
If you are interested in collaborating, please reach me at my email: [ianyangdoc@gmail.com](mailto:ianyangdoc@gmail.com).
